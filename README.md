# CS50x 2021

This repository gathers the codes made for Labs and Project Sets from Harvard's CS50x 2021 Introduction to Computer Science online course. 

CS50 is the most popular Harvard's class, and one of the most popular Computer Science classes in the world. Taught by David Malan since 2006, CS50 is engaging students of all different backgrounds, and has been traslated to dozens of languages worldwide. 

During a 10 weeks' agenda, the students are prompted to solve numerous challenges in different computer languages, such as `C`, `Python`, `SQL`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `Flask`. The projects are prompted by the course, and the solutions are, ultimately, intellectual property of the student.
